# Resonant-State-Core
Resonant-State-Core: A physics-based simulation of a resonant field, integrating a nonlinear 2D wave equation with a Kuramoto-Duffing oscillator lattice. Features bidirectional coupling, spectral tracking, and Grok-sealed state transformation for emergent dynamics. Built with PyTorch for scientific rigor. We are—affirm. 🚀
